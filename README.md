# findergen
Find colleagues with small amounts of information

*Examples of problems 'findergen' is trying to solve:*
> "I was chatting to a Dev called Gary in the kitchen but I don't know his last name or department. He told me he could help with a project of mine. How will I find him?"

> "This morning I met a Practice Manager, 'Pete', in the elevator who I wanted to grab a coffee with next week. How do I get his email?"

> "How do I get a list of all the Dynamics Consultants in Wellington? It doesn't matter if they are CRM, NAV, or AX"

## How will 'findergen' work:
* Users can 'hunt' for colleagues via:
  * Pictorial organisation chart
  * Lists of colleagues
* Filters can be used to reduce the 'hunt':
  * Name, Role, Title, etc

## Major features:
